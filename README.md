I am luduvigo. I build products, mostly in web3. 

I’ve done many things so far, including founding startups that raised millions of dollars, leading tech teams, organising meetups, being part of many communities in the Startup and Crypto world, organising football tournaments, being addicted to Michelin-starred restaurants, and many more.

The main things that I’ve learned are that you’ll fail more times than you’ll succeed and that only consistency will make you successful.
